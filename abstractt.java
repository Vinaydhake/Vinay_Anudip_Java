/*What is Abstraction in Java?
Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and 
showing only essential features to the user.

In Java, this is done using:

abstract classes

abstract methods

You can think of it like using a TV remote‚Äîyou press the power button, 
and the TV turns on. You don‚Äôt know (and don‚Äôt need to know) the internal electronics that make that happen.

üèé Real-Life Analogy: Car and Accelerator
What You Know as a Driver:
When you press the accelerator, the car speeds up.

What You Don‚Äôt See (Hidden Details):
Sensors detect the pedal press.

Fuel is injected into the engine (in petrol cars).

Electric current increases (in electric cars).

Engine or motor increases RPM (revolutions per minute).

Wheels rotate faster, moving the car quicker.

 All of this is complex. As a driver, you don't care how it works‚Äîonly that it works.*/
